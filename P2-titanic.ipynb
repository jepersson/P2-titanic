    "\n",
    "From the last plot we can see that our analysis shows a relation between higher age and a lower chance of surviving the shipwreck for all for all classes and sexes. Further the different combinations of passenger sex and class can be ranked the following way, from highest probability of survival to lowest compared to other passengers of the same age. (Color from above plot in brackets)\n",

    "5. Second class men (Green)\n",
    "6. Third class men (Blue)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I believe we can answer our initial questions. Did age, class (using passenger class as a proxy here), and/or sex influence the probability of survival? Based on our findings we can with statistical certainty say, yes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the above ranked list, or plot, that women in general had a higher probability than men of surviving the shipwreck and that upper class passengers were favored over other passengers of the same gender. Sex did almost always have a priority over class with the exception being first class male passengers vs third class women.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least personally I would like to draw the conclusion that the majority of passengers, second and third class men, did behave like gentlemen even until the end on the sinking ship."

    "## Limitations and further studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it might look and sound as if we have a pretty clear picture of what factors affected the probability of survival the night of the Titanic shipwreck it is important to remember that with the data and methods used, we are only able to prove that there are a correlation between the variables examined. We would need more data and a controlled environment to be able to draw any conclusions regarding the causality between the relationships we observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made a lot of assumptions regarding our data such as using passenger class as a proxy for social class (reality might be much more nuanced), and also simply throwing away rows and columns with missing values which was fine for this level of analysis. However, to proceed any further it would be necessary to make use of these now unused data points by filling in the holes rather than throwing them away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than just imputations there are also some data hidden in columns that could be used for further analysis after some more reworking of the original dataset. For example, we could calculate the size of the group the passenger were travelling with using the 'SibSp' and 'Parch' columns to see if this had any influence on their survival or not. Using some simple text processing we could also break out any titles present in the 'Name' columns to further describe the social status of the passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe there are even more things that could be done but to keep the length down and also to keep us inside the confines of my current abilities this have to be left for the future."
